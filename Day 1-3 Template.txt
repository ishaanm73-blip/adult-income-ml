# Credit Risk Analysis (Day 1–3)

This repository contains the first three days of work on a credit risk analysis project.  
It includes:

### Day 1:
- Data loading
- Cleaning & preprocessing using Scikit-Learn Pipelines
- Fixing missing values & encoding

### Day 2:
- Univariate & Bivariate EDA
- Correlation analysis
- Statistical distribution plots

### Day 3:
- Train-test split
- Baseline models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Note: ROC-AUC scoring will be added in Day 4 after binary transformation of target.

### Files Included:
- `EDA_and_Modeling_Day1_to_Day3.ipynb` — main notebook
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies
- `/data/` folder — contains notes about dataset source

### Upcoming Work:
- Add ROC-AUC analysis
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Feature selection & engineering
- Final model saving using joblib
